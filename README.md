#smalltalk

smalltalk uses your facebook account to show your profile
to devices around you. You can also see other devices around
you by shaking your iOS device. Please use smalltalk on an iPhone 6 or 6s.


The application is currently under developement, and can
be used with the following accounts.

Account 1:

Username: kabsgogs@gmail.com
Password: Helloworld123

Account 2: 

Username: kabgog@gmail.com
Password: Helloworld123


To test the app, open it on two different devices, an 
xcode simulator is fine. After logging in with facebook,
a card should display shortly. Once a device has been found,
the number in the bottom left will change. **Shake the device 
to view the new profile.**
